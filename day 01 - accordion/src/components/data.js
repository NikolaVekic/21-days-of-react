    question: "What is the virtual DOM?",
    answer:
      "The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by React that involves keeping a virtual representation of the UI in memory and syncing it with the real DOM through a library such as ReactDOM. This process, known as reconciliation, allows React to efficiently update the UI by only changing the parts of the DOM that have actually changed.",
